    "content": "Poll: Do you love the Arabic Language?🎈\nThank you to all the students who are working hard to present the values of the school during its upcoming Annual Fundraiser.👍\nGreat care is going into showing how our school values the Arabic language. The Arabic language is a fundamental right of every Muslim, and it is a deprivation to not be taught it, as it is the key to understanding the Quran and Sunnah (please refer to our language policy which is attached for further information). \nWe thank the school board for ensuring that “Submission to the Will of Allah” included the path to achieving that through the Arabic language. And we thank the teachers and admin for their collaboration to make that possible. \nI hope you will take a few minutes to read about some of the reasons why I love the Arabic language!\nAnd to clarify any misunderstandings, I have shared the subject briefs for Arabic B and Arabic AB Initio (or Language B and AB Initio) from the IB Programme. Please note this about the Initio course:   Offered at SL only, language ab initio is a language acquisition course designed for students with no previous experience in—or very little exposure to—the target language.\n 📢Any student who has already had two years of Arabic cannot take that course.\nCheck out the links below!❣️\nhttps://www.britishcouncil.org/voices-magazine/surprising-facts-about-arabic-language\nhttps://medium.com/@learningarabicwithangela/20-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-arabic-language-49615997b6e5\nhttps://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/curriculum/language-acquisition/language-b/\nLanguage ab initio course - International Baccalaureate®\nDeveloping in a language - International Baccalaureate®\nBarak Allah feekum!\nSome helpful comparisons below:",
