    "content": "Poll: Do you love the Arabic Language?🎈\nThank you to all the students who are working hard to present the values of the school during its upcoming Annual Fundraiser.👍\nGreat care is going into showing how our school values the Arabic language. The Arabic language is a fundamental right of every Muslim, and it is a deprivation to not be taught it, as it is the key to understanding the Quran and Sunnah (please refer to our language policy which is attached for further information). \nWe thank the school board for ensuring that “Submission to the Will of Allah” included the path to achieving that through the Arabic language. And we thank the teachers and admin for their collaboration to make that possible. \nI hope you will take a few minutes to read about some of the reasons why I love the Arabic language!\nAnd to clarify any misunderstandings, I have shared the subject briefs for Arabic B and Arabic AB Initio (or Language B and AB Initio) from the IB Programme. Please note this about the Initio course:   Offered at SL only, language ab initio is a language acquisition course designed for students with no previous experience in—or very little exposure to—the target language.\n 📢Any student who has already had two years of Arabic cannot take that course.\nCheck out the links below!❣️\nhttps://www.britishcouncil.org/voices-magazine/surprising-facts-about-arabic-language\nhttps://medium.com/@learningarabicwithangela/20-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-arabic-language-49615997b6e5\nhttps://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/curriculum/language-acquisition/language-b/\nLanguage ab initio course - International Baccalaureate®\nDeveloping in a language - International Baccalaureate®\nBarak Allah feekum!\nSome helpful comparisons below:",

If any portion of your AP Exam or any of your submissions are scored by your school or AP Teacher, those scores are final and you may not challenge them in arbitration (under Section 8 below) or otherwise.   \nEach College Board contractor is a third-party beneficiary and is entitled to the rights and benefits under this Agreement and may enforce the provisions of this Agreement as if it were a party to this Agreement. \nCollege Board is not responsible for providing an internet connection or for internet service interruptions or errors outside of College Board’s control, such as data transmission errors on the public internet. \nCollege Board is not responsible for any equipment.  \nCollege Board is not responsible for personal property, including prohibited items, brought to the AP Exam that are lost, stolen, or damaged.  \nCollege Board is not responsible for your failure to follow directions and instructions relating to taking the AP Exam. \nAll College Board policies and requirements (i) referenced in these Terms and Conditions and (ii) relating to registering for the AP Exam located at apstudents.collegeboard.org/register-for-ap-exams, taking the AP Exam located at apstudents.collegeboard.org/about-ap-exams, and scores located at apstudents.collegeboard.org/about-ap-scores are part of these Terms and Conditions. \nCollege Board may update its policies and requirements from time to time and they are subject to change up to one week prior to your test date. You are required to review these prior to each test administration.\nAll College Board tests, including AP Exams, test-related documents and materials, and test preparation materials (“Test Content”) are copyrighted works owned by College Board and protected by the laws of the United States and other countries.  \nAll software, webpages, algorithms, processes, and technologies, including the Application, through which you access and take the AP Exam, your answers are scored, and the test is secured and proctored, but excluding your device, your internet service provider (ISP) and the public internet, (collectively, the “Test Platform”) belong to College Board and its licensors.   \nYou shall not screenshot or attempt to make any image, copy, or download Test Content or the Test. You shall not attempt to decompile, reverse engineer, or disassemble the Test Platform.  \nAll answers and answer documents you submit including all essay responses, portfolios, and audio or visual work are owned by the College Board, and these may be used by College Board for any purpose, subject to the Privacy Policies located at  privacy.collegeboard.org, and in these Terms and Conditions; however, you have independent rights to your scores, including the right to access, retain, and use your scores.\nGeneral Arbitration Rules (\"General Arbitration Rules\")\nAll disputes between you and College Board (each a “party”) that relate in any way to registering for, participating in, or taking the AP Exam, including but not limited to requesting or receiving test accommodations, score reporting, the use of your data, test security issues, or the Score Validity Process (defined in the “Invalid Scores” section herein), will exclusively be resolved in binding arbitration or small claims court. By agreeing to arbitration in accordance with this section, you are waiving your right to have your dispute heard by a judge or jury except as set forth below. Disputes relating to the Score Validity Process are subject to both these General Arbitration Rules and the Supplemental Arbitration Rules defined in Section 8(b) below. If there is a conflict between the General Arbitration Rules and the Supplemental Arbitration Rules, the Supplemental Arbitration Rules will control.\nEither party can seek to have a claim resolved in small claims court if the rules of that court will allow it. Additionally, and except for disputes relating to the Score Validity Process under the Supplemental Arbitration Rules below, if the claims asserted in any request or demand for arbitration could have been brought in small claims court, then either you or College Board may elect to have the claims heard in small claims court, rather than in arbitration, at any time before an arbitrator is appointed, by notifying the other party of that election in writing. Any dispute about whether a claim qualifies for small claims court will be resolved by that court and not by an arbitrator. In the event that either party elects to have their claims heard in small claims court, the arbitration proceeding will remain closed unless and until there is a decision by the small claims court that the claim should proceed in arbitration.\nAll claims that are not decided in small claims court must be resolved through binding, individual arbitration before a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, supplemented by the AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules as applicable, in effect at the time a request for arbitration is filed with the AAA. Copies of the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules and the AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules are located at adr.org. The arbitrator will have the authority to resolve any dispute regarding the scope or enforceability of these Rules, except only a court can decide claims that a party violated the intellectual property rights of the other party. In addition, only a court can decide issues relating to (a) the pre-arbitration requirements contained in these Rules or (b) the interpretation of the prohibition of class and representative actions contained in these Rules.\nBefore commencing a small claims court or arbitration proceeding, that party (the \"complainant\") must provide the other party (the \"respondent\") with a written notice of dispute that includes the complainant's name and contact information, a detailed description of the dispute, relevant documents, the specific relief sought, and the complainant's physical signature (signature by counsel to the party is not sufficient). For purposes of clarity and as stated above, this includes disputes relating to the Score Validity Process set forth below in Subsection 8(b). If you are the complainant, send the notice of dispute by first class mail, FedEx, or UPS to Legal Department, 250 Vesey Street, New York, NY 10281. Alternatively, you (or your counsel) can send the notice of dispute to legalhelp@collegeboard.org. A member of College Board’s Legal Department will then contact you (or your counsel) to attempt to resolve the dispute through informal good faith negotiations as described below. College Board will send its notice of dispute to your address as reflected in College Board's records.\nAlso, before the complainant may commence a small claims court or arbitration proceeding, the parties must attempt to resolve the dispute through informal, good-faith negotiation. If the parties have not resolved the dispute within sixty (60) days of the respondent’s receipt of the written notice of dispute, the parties will mutually schedule a settlement conference which must occur within fourteen (14) days of the completion of the sixty (60) day period, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. Each party must personally appear at the settlement conference (if a party is represented by counsel, their counsel may also participate), and appearances may be made telephonically or by video. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute at the settlement conference, either party may commence arbitration or file a small claims court proceeding. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process. If any aspect of the requirements in this Subsection 8(a) has not been met, a court can enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration or the assessment of any arbitration fees. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the AAA cannot accept or administer an arbitration, nor assess any fees for an arbitration, that has not met the requirements of this Subsection 8(a). If the arbitration is already pending, it must be dismissed.\nIf the dispute proceeds to arbitration, the complainant must personally attend all arbitration conferences, hearings, and mediations scheduled by the AAA or by an arbitrator or mediator appointed by the AAA. If the complainant is represented by counsel, the complainant’s counsel may also participate, and all participation may be made telephonically or by video except as directed by the arbitrator or mediator. If a complainant fails to personally appear at any conference, hearing or mediation scheduled by the AAA or by an AAA arbitrator or mediator, regardless of whether the complainant’s counsel attends, the arbitrator will administratively close the arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless the complainant shows good cause as to why the complainant was not able to attend the conference, hearing, or mediation.\nThis arbitration will be conducted as a documents-only arbitration (i.e., there will be no in-person or telephonic hearing) unless otherwise agreed by the parties or required by the arbitrator. If the parties agree to or the arbitrator requires proceedings, such proceedings should be conducted at a location that is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the parties agree that the proceedings will be conducted via a video or telephonic call or, in the event that face-to-face proceedings are agreed to by the parties or required by the arbitrator, at a location that is reasonably convenient to both parties in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator may consider rulings in arbitrations involving other individuals, but an arbitrator's rulings will not be binding in proceedings involving different individuals. The existence and content of the arbitration proceedings, including documents and briefs submitted by the parties; any correspondence from the AAA; and correspondence, orders, and awards issued by the arbitrator, will remain strictly confidential and will not be disclosed to any third party without the express written consent from the other party, unless disclosure to the third party is reasonably required in the context of conducting the arbitration proceedings or related court proceedings.\nFor disputes meeting the definition of “Mass Arbitration” under the AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, the parties agree that the dispute is subject to the AAA’s Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules and the parties agree to the appointment of a Process Arbitrator, except as may otherwise be decided by the arbitrator or the AAA.\nThe parties agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. governs this section, and it is the intent of the parties that the FAA will preempt all State laws to the fullest extent permitted by law.\nNo arbitration may be maintained as a class or collective action; a party may bring a claim only on their own behalf and cannot seek a relief that would affect other individuals. Unless all parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator will not have the authority to consolidate the claims of more than 1 individual, conduct any class or collective proceeding, make any class or collective award, or make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration, without the express written consent of College Board.\nPayment of all filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees and costs will be governed by the AAA's rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then College Board may seek applicable fee-shifting.\n \nSupplemental Arbitration Rules for the Score Validity Process (\"Supplemental Arbitration Rules\")\nIf you receive a notice from College Board that your scores are subject to the Score Validity Process, you may be provided with the option to choose arbitration. In addition to the General Arbitration Rules, except as set forth herein, the below rules will apply. \nThe sole issue for the arbitrator to decide is whether College Board acted in good faith and followed the Score Validity Process. \nThis arbitration will be based only on (i) the documents you submitted to College Board pursuant to the Score Validity Process and (ii) College Board documents unless otherwise agreed by the parties or required by the arbitrator. \nIf the arbitrator finds that College Board did not act in good faith in deciding to cancel your scores, your scores will not be canceled (or they will be reinstated, if applicable). \nAll other disputes with College Board will be resolved solely by the General Arbitration Rules in Subsection 8(a) above, except as set forth herein. \nThis Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York without regard to choice or conflict of law principles. All disputes arising from or related to this Agreement that are not subject to arbitration under Section 8 shall be resolved exclusively in the state and federal courts located in New York County, New York State and each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts. Each Party expressly waives any right to a jury trial in any lawsuit arising from or related to this Agreement. \nEXCEPT TO THE EXTENT FINALLY DETERMINED TO BE PROHIBITED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABLITY OF COLLEGE BOARD TO YOU OR ANYONE CLAIMING BY OR THROUGH YOU OR ON YOUR BEHALF, FOR ANY CLAIMS, LOSSES, COSTS, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING FROM OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO COLLEGE BOARD, OR ANY TEST ADMINISTRATION BY COLLEGE BOARD, FROM ANY CAUSE, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TEST REGISTRATION FEES YOU PAID OR $100.00, WHICHEVER IS GREATER. IN ADDITION, COLLEGE BOARD WILL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY EVENT FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES.  \nCOLLEGE BOARD MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE AP EXAM, EXAM CONTENT, OR TESTING APPLICATION INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION A WARRANTY THAT THE TESTING EXPERIENCE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE.

    "content": "Life after Ramadan\nRamadan is a special time when our hearts feel closer to Allah, and our good habits shine. But when Ramadan ends, it’s natural to wonder how to keep the Ramadan spirit alive after Ramadan.\nIt’s easy to stay on track when everyone’s focused on worship, but the real challenge is keeping up those good habits when life returns to normal.\nWhat to do after Ramadan?\nLet’s share some simple and practical tips to help you continue the good deeds and positive changes from Ramadan all year round.\nWhat to Do After Ramadan: Post-Ramadan Activities\nThere are several ways we can keep Ramadan habits active in ourselves.\n1. Evaluate Your Ramadan\nEvaluate your Ramadan by looking at your current state. It may be impossible to perform good deeds at the level of Ramadan after the month is over. But even if you can continue a fraction of them after Eid, it is a good indication that Ramadan positively affected you and that Allah accepted your fasts.\nAlso, note down your mistakes and areas that need improvement. Make a promise to better yourself in the next Ramadan.\n2. Keep Missed Fasting\nIf you missed any fasts in Ramadan due to illness or traveling, make up for them whenever possible. Allah says in the Quran:\nفَمَن شَهِدَ مِنكُمُ ٱلشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ ۖ وَمَن كَانَ مَرِيضًا أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍۢ فَعِدَّةٌۭ مِّنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ \nMeaning: “So whoever sights [the crescent of] the month (Ramadan), let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a journey—then an equal number of other days.” [Surah Al Baqarah: 185]\nHowever, if you missed any fasts intentionally, repent to Allah immediately and make up for the broken fasts from Shawwal. Make a promise to Allah that you will never intentionally break your fasts during Ramadan again.\n3. Give More Time to Your Salah\nDuring Ramadan, we spend hours standing before Allah in Taraweeh, Tahajjud, Salatut Duha, and other voluntary prayers. Even though we might not be able to do it throughout the year, we should pray Nafl prayers whenever we can and make it a habit, at least two rokaa.\nIf you are busy and can’t spend enough time in prayers, at least do not miss the 12 Sunnah prayers daily. Prophet ﷺ said: \nمَنْ ثَابَرَ عَلَى ثِنْتَىْ عَشْرَةَ رَكْعَةً مِنَ السُّنَّةِ بَنَى اللَّهُ لَهُ بَيْتًا فِي الْجَنَّةِ أَرْبَعِ رَكَعَاتٍ قَبْلَ الظُّهْرِ وَرَكْعَتَيْنِ بَعْدَهَا وَرَكْعَتَيْنِ بَعْدَ الْمَغْرِبِ وَرَكْعَتَيْنِ بَعْدَ الْعِشَاءِ وَرَكْعَتَيْنِ قَبْلَ الْفَجْرِ\nMeaning: “Whoever is regular with twelve Rak’ah of Sunnah (prayer), Allah will build a house for him in Paradise: Four Rak’ah before Zuhr, two Rak’ah after it, two Rak’ah after Maghrib, two Rak’ah after Isha, and two Rak’ah before Fajr.” [Jami at Timidhi: 414]\n4. Voluntary Fasting\nIt’s recommended to keep voluntary fasting throughout the year as much as you can. It includes fasting in Shawwal, fasting in Ashura, fasting in Dhul Hijjah, especially on Arafah day, etc. You can also keep fasting on ayyam al beed (white days- 13, 14, 15) each lunar month, fasting on Monday and Thursday each week, and more.\n5. Pray Tahajjud\nDuring Ramadan, most of us develop the habit of praying Tahajjud prayers before Sehri. We stand before Allah in prayer, reciting the glorious Quran and pondering on its meaning in hopes of rewards from Allah. \nWe can all testify to its positive impact on us. It serves as a great tool for believers to stay on the right path throughout their entire lives. Allah says in the Quran: \nإِنَّ نَاشِئَةَ ٱلَّيْلِ هِىَ أَشَدُّ وَطْـًۭٔا وَأَقْوَمُ قِيلًا \nMeaning: “Truly, rising by night (for the prayer of tahajjud) is the most effective way to subdue (one’s base self) and to make speech more upright.” [Surah Al Muzzammil: 6]\nWe should keep the practice of praying Tahajjud to maintain the spirit of Ramadan throughout the year.\n6. Set a Time for Reciting the Quran\nWe all know that Ramadan is the month when the glorious Quran was revealed. We recite the Word of Allah a lot during this month. Some of us even do Quran Khatam during this honorable month. That is all great. But what is the purpose of the Quran’s revelation? Is it so that we recite it only during Ramadan and let dust build up for the rest of the year? Allah says in the Quran: \nشَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أُنزِلَ فِيهِ ٱلْقُرْءَانُ هُدًۭى لِّلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّنَـٰتٍۢ مِّنَ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَٱلْفُرْقَانِ ١٨٥\nThe month of Ramadan is the one in which the Qur’ān was revealed as guidance for mankind and as clear signs that show the right way and distinguish between right and wrong. [Surah Al Baqarah: 185]\nSo, the purpose of the Quran is to live by its teachings every day. There is no alternative to reciting it regularly. Usually, we develop the habit of reciting the Quran consistently every day during Ramadan. This habit should be a part of our daily lives. We should set a particular time of the day and dedicate it to the recitation of the Quran. You can use many Quran app to understand it better.\n7. Spend Time in Learning Deen\nDuring Ramadan, especially during I’tikaf, many of us develop the habit of reading Islamic books like Seerah, Aqidah, Tafsir, and more. We should continue this good habit and dedicate a particular time each day or at least once a week to learn about our deen.\nThis will have a lasting impact on our Islamic knowledge growth and help us become better Muslims and maybe do Dawah to non-Muslims.\n8. Daily Adhkar\nDon’t miss your daily adhkars after Ramadan. They gain us protection, mercy, forgiveness, blessings, and all the goodness of this world and hereafter. \nSince we tend to say them more often during Ramadan, we need to carry this habit forward after Ramadan as well.\n9. Continue Giving Sadaqah\nThe virtues of giving Sadaqah are many. It gains us Allah’s forgiveness and erases His anger towards us. \nSadaqah during Ramadan is special because rewards are multiplied many times. That’s why many people opt to pay their Zakat and Sadaqah during this blessed month. This is great. But this habit needs to continue after Ramadan as well. The Messenger of Allah (SM) said:\nمَا مِنْ يَوْمٍ يُصْبِحُ الْعِبَادُ فِيهِ إِلاَّ مَلَكَانِ يَنْزِلاَنِ فَيَقُولُ أَحَدُهُمَا اللَّهُمَّ أَعْطِ مُنْفِقًا خَلَفًا، وَيَقُولُ الآخَرُ اللَّهُمَّ أَعْطِ مُمْسِكًا تَلَفًا\nMeaning: “Every day two angels come down from Heaven and one of them says, ‘O Allah! Compensate every person who spends in Your Cause,’ and the other (angel) says, ‘O Allah! Destroy every miser.’ ” [Sahih Al Bukhari: 1442]\nThus, one of the to-do after Ramadan is to continue spending in the path of Allah regularly, even if little.\n10. Improve Manners\nOne of the most important aspects of Ramadan is to restrain oneself from ill speeches and actions. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: \nمَنْ لَمْ يَدَعْ قَوْلَ الزُّورِ وَالْعَمَلَ بِهِ فَلَيْسَ لِلَّهِ حَاجَةٌ بِأَنْ يَدَعَ طَعَامَهُ وَشَرَابَهُ\nMeaning: “Whoever does not leave false speech, and acting according to it, then Allah is not in any need of him leaving his food and his drink.” [Jami At Tirmidhi: 707]\nAfter Ramadan, we find many returning to their old ways of slanging and misbehaving with people. If that is the case with us, then our Ramadan will not be accepted by Allah. Thus, we must improve our manners and stay away from such behavior. \n11. Stay Away from Sins\nIf you plan on committing sins after Ramadan, think again. K’ab bin Malik (R) said: \n“Whoever fasts the month of Ramadan and says to himself that he will return to sinful disobedience when Ramadan is over, his fasting is rejected.” [Lataif al Ma’arif: 1/222]\nSo, one way to know whether Allah accepted our fasts or not is to see whether our course of action has changed. If we return to our same old ways before Ramadan, then there is no point in fasting. Thus, we must say goodbye to the ways of sins after Ramadan. \nFAQs\nQ. How do I know if Allah accepted my fasts during Ramadan? \nAns. If you have the patience to do good deeds after Ramadan, it is a good sign that Allah accepted your fasts. \nConclusion\nAllah Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala sends Ramadan every year so that we can become righteous. It does not come as a ritual or festival, rather, It arrives as a life changer. Thus, we must learn about what to do after Ramadan and continue doing good deeds after the blessed month has passed. We must stay on the path of righteousness and away from evil ones.\nMay Allah give us Tawfiq",
